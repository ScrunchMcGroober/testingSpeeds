# testingSpeeds
Using this to ask a question about Julia speeds.
The book assigns an exercise in which the reader is prompted to write a program that will sort 3 user-generated numbers in ascending order. Contained in this repository are two possible solutions to this problem. I wish to know how I can tell which one is more efficient with regards not only to time, but to resource usage.
